Zip-Case-X File Protector SV
============================

This is the **"Stable Version"** of my File Protection programs
circa 2001.

## Compatibility

Files encrypted in one Operating System are compatible with the others
too.

Ensure that the file names are in the **DOS 8.3 format**
(such as `.HTM`, `.MPG` ) for best compatibility.

The File to be Encrypted must ideally be in the current working
directory. Avoid usage of `.` and `..` or Directory separators
such as `/` or `\` in files, we don't try to interpret them.

## How to Use

Go to the Appropriate Binary Executables Directory. Then Use:

```shell
  encom File <Encrypted File, Default is FPCODED.ZCX>
```

to encrypt your file, and

```shell
  decom <Encrypted File, Default is FPCODED.ZCX>
```

to restore your original file.

## Restrictions

This should not be used for any illegal purposes whatsoever.
Use your judgment.

Please see accompanying `LICENSE` for how this code is meant
to be used.

## Compatibility

When you use the most current version, files in the previous
versions won't work. So please retain the Older Version of
the Executables for Decrypting Purposes.

## Thank You and Feedback

Reach out to me for any feedback.

Now Enjoy!
