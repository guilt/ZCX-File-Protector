Zip-Case-X File Protector SV
============================

This is the **"Stable Version"** of my File Protection programs
circa 2001-2002.

## Compatibility

Files encrypted in one Operating System are compatible with the others
too, but ensure that the file names are in the **DOS 8.3 format**
(such as `.HTM`, `.MPG` ) for maximum compatibility. The File to be
Encrypted must ideally be in the current directory. Avoid usage of `.`
and `..` or Directory slashes in files, we do not attempt
to interpret them.

## How to Use

Go to the Appropriate Binary Executables Directory. Then Use:

      encom <Name of the Original File> <Name of the Encrypted File, Optional>

to encrypt your file, and

      decom <Name of the Encrypted file>

to restore your original file.

## Restrictions

This should not be used for any illegal purposes whatsoever.
But use your judgment.

## Compatibility

When you use the most current version, files in the previous
versions won't Comply. So please retain the Older Version of
the Executable for Decrypting Purposes. Thank You for getting
this.

## Thank You and Feedback

Reach out to me for any feedback.

Now Enjoy!
