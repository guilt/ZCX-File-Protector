Zip-Case-X File Protector SV
============================

This is the Stable Version of my File Protection programs.

Files encrypted in one Operating System  are compatible with the others
too, but ensure that the file names are initially in the DOS 8.3 format
(such as .HTM, .MPG ). The File to be Encoded must be in the current
directory. Avoid usage of . and .. or Directory Slashes in files, as
DOS and Unix / Linux are incompatible in that aspect.

## How to Use

Go to the Appropriate Binary Executables Directory. Then Use:

      encom <Name of the File to be Encoded> <Name of the Encoded File, Optional>

to encode your file, and

      decom <Name of the Encoded file>

to restore your original file.

## Restrictions

This should not be used for any Bad Purposes Whatsoever. Use your judgment.

## Compatibility

When you use this most current version, files in the previous
versions won't Comply. So please retain the Older Version for
Decrypting Purposes. Thank You for getting this Product.
